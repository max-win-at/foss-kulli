# Foss Kulli
> A sticky note SPA PWA for desktop and mobile browsers

## Idea
Foss Kulli is an area for placing digital sticky notes like simple texts and links.
- When on the page, starting to type will spawn a new sticky note.
- - Pressing enter will accept it.
- - Pressing esc or taping or clicking the empty area will discard it.
- When on page pressing the `paste` shortcut will create a new sticky note with the clipboard content
- When selecting an exsting sticky note an edit item and drag item handle appears bottom right and a delete item handle appears bottom left.
- Dragging one note onto another stacks them. In addition to the already existing, a toggle through note stack, unstack, and merge stack to single note handle appears
- While dragging only the drag handle remains visible
